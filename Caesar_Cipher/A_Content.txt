Caesar Cipher:
The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest forms of encryption 
. It's named after Julius Caesar, who used it to send secret messages.

1). Encryption (Hiding the Message):
Encryption is when you take a normal message (called plaintext) and change it so no one can read
 it unless they know the secret (called a key).
In the Caesar Cipher, encryption works by shifting each letter in the message by a certain number
 of places in the alphabet.

Example:
Original message: HELLO
Key (shift): >>3
Alphabet: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Shift each letter 3 steps forward:
H → K
E → H
L → O
L → O
O → R
Encrypted message: KHOOR

2). Decryption (Getting the Message Back):
Decryption is when you take the encrypted message and shift the letters back by the same number 
to get the original message.
Using the same key (3):
K → H
H → E
O → L
O → L
R → O
Decrypted message: HELLO
