#  Higher or Lower: Follower Count Game

A simple terminal-based game where players guess who has more Instagram followers between two public figures. Inspired by the classic "Higher or Lower" format.

---

##  How It Works

- Two accounts (A and B) are randomly selected.
- You see a brief description of each (name, profession, and country).
- You guess which account has more followers by typing `'a'` or `'b'`.
- If you're right, your score increases and the game continues.
- If you're wrong, the game ends and your final score is shown.

##  Features

- Score tracking

- Continuous play until a wrong guess is made
